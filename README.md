It's a renderer, I tend to overcomplicate things and then not learn anything so I'm strictly limiting it to just being a Vulkan/SDL3 based renderer, no fluff just features. I don't intend for it to be used for anything, I just wanna try implementing a bunch of cool stuff, like volumetric smoke, global illumination, gpu-based compute particles, etc... :)

Will add screenshots and a complete feature list. At some point ;).
